            <p>During a 3D course I got the chance to build an animation from
              scratch.
              In this winter weather I wanted something colourful and happy.

              This was a 100 hours project which included planning independently
              to deadlines and milestones. I started sketching and then
              building a minimum viable product and went
              with the agile approach adjusting and
              improving. I like to implement processes from
              my work experience to my personal projects as well to get a clear
              structure and established results.

              I feel for the elephants among many other creatures that are in
              danger, and we are to blame.
              <br>
              <br>
              This print grew from the theme “contrast” and the fact that in too
              many places we see animals outside their natural habitat, caged.
              I wanted the illustration to reflect the contrast of a creature
              standing on a floor instead of the ground but in the same time
              being free in the universe, as it should be.

              I had lived in Stockholm for a year and while I began to feel like
              home in cold the capital, I also went on with a constant feeling
              of wanting to be somewhere else.
              <br>
              <br>
              To be creative that summer was my oasis among concrete and steel.
              The oasis project includes three oil paintings of imaginary
              landscapes which are displayed in the northern Sweden.

            <h1>DÖMD - A student event</h1>

              DÖMD is a three days event with music, parties and one of northern
              Europe's largest amateur dart competitions with 128 competing teams
              which I arranged together with 12 other students.

               I was part of a three person graphics team and responsible for
               marketing  and graphics of the event. That involved keeping in
              touch with sponsors, creating prints, designing the website and
              mobile app as well as delivering within tight deadlines. The
              printings included advertising posters, a logotype, flights for
              darts, a folder about the event and stickers for beer bottles.

            <p>
              Hello there!
              <br>
              <br>
              This is my portfolio and here I'll display my projects, it's a
              work in progress and therefore it can be a bit messy from time to
              time.
              <br>
              <br>
              When I decided to create my own portfolio I was kinda' new to the whole
              web design/ UX business and did a lot of research on how to progress.
              I followed a design process, much like this one:
            </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Analysis</li>
                <li>Concept</li>
                <li>Design</li>
                <li>Technique/method</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
              And it went on well: I did my research, I sketched on paper, I
              iterated and finally I had a UI made in Illustrator which you can
              see in the bottom of this page. This was the "finale" design sketch
              before I actually began to develop the site. And as a newbie I
              really thought that this was how my site would look like when I
              was finished. I think it's fun to see how the site developed from it.
              <br>
              <br>
              This was like two years ago now and you can see a lot has changed.
              I still adore the mint colour, but I felt that I had to start from
              the beginning, a fresh start!
              <br>
              <br>
              I now live in Cambridge, UK, freelancing at the moment and just enjoying
              the time here and trying to find stuff I like to do. For example
              drinking real ales at cosy Brittish pubs and crafting stuff at home
              as well as catching up and developing my UX ninja skills.
